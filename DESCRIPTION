Description: An implementation of the Uniform Manifold Approximation and
    Projection dimensionality reduction by McInnes et al. (2018)
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1802.03426>. It also provides means to transform new data and
    to carry out supervised dimensionality reduction. An implementation of
    the related LargeVis method of Tang et al. (2016) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1602.00370>
    is also provided. This is a complete re-implementation in R (and C++,
    via the 'Rcpp' package): no Python installation is required. See the
    uwot website (<https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot>) for more
    documentation and examples.
