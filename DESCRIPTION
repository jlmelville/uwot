Description: An implementation of the Uniform Manifold Approximation and 
    Projection dimensionality reduction by McInnes et al. (2018) 
    <arXiv:1802.03426>. It also provides means to transform new data and to 
    carry out supervised dimensionality reduction. An implementation of the 
    related LargeVis method of Tang et al. (2016) <arXiv:1602.00370> is also 
    provided. This is a complete re-implementation in R (and C++, via the 'Rcpp'
    package): no Python installation is required. See the uwot website 
    (<https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot>) for more documentation and examples.
