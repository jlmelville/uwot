title: "Nearest Neighbor Format"
---

The Python implementation of UMAP supports lots of distance metrics; `uwot` does
not, because it depends on the distance metrics supported by `RcppAnnoy`, which
in turn depends on those supported by `Annoy`. For more flexibility, at the
cost of convenience, you can generate nearest neighbor data for `X` by some
other means and pass that to `umap` (or `tumap` or `lvish`) directly via the
`nn_method` parameter.

### Nearest Neighbor Graph Format

The format expected by `nn_method` is a `list` containing the following two
entries:

* `idx`: a matrix of dimension `n_vertices x n_neighbors`, where each row
contains the indexes (starting at `1`) of the nearest neighbors of each item
(vertex) in the dataset. Each item is always the nearest neighbor of itself, so
the first element in row `i` should always be `i`. If it isn't then either you
are using a really weird non-metric distance or your approximate nearest
neighbor method is returning way too approximate results. In either case, you
should expect bad results.
* `dist`: a matrix of dimension `n_vertices x n_neighbors`, where each row
contains the distances of the nearest neighbors of each item (vertex) in the
dataset, in Each item is always the nearest neighbor of itself, so the first
element in row `i` should always be `0.0`.

### Sparse Distance Matrix Format

Alternatively, you can pass a sparse distance matrix where:

* the format should be `dgCMatrix` (the typical sparse matrix format).
* non-zero entries are the distances.
* dimensions are of `n_vertices x n_vertices` for `umap` and 
`n_model_vertices x n_vertices` for `umap_transform`
    * to put it another way: the neighbor distances should be arranged so that
    the non-zero entries in the `i`th column of the matrix contains the 
    distances between observation `i` and its nearest neighbors.
* An advantage of using a sparse distance matrix: you are not restricted to a
fixed value of `n_neighbors` for each observation. Each column can contain a
different number of non-zero distances. See the paper by 
[Dalmia and Sia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05525) for why you might want to do
this. The graph edge weight calculation will be adjusted to account for the 
different number of neighbors of each observation. There must be at least one
neighbor for each observation.
* Explicit zero distances will be removed from the matrix. This is in contrast
to the use of the nearest neighbor list matrix format where typically the zero
distance between an observation and itself is found as part of the nearest
neighbor search routine. The sparse distance matrix approach will account for
the zero self-distance being implicit. To keep explicit zero distances between
other observations set them to a small but non-zero value, e.g. `1e-10`.
* A slight disadvantage with using a distance matrix is that the distances need
to be sorted.
* Sparse distance matrix input is not currently supported for the `lvish` 
method.

If you use pre-computed nearest neighbor data, be aware that:

* You can't use pre-computed nearest neighbor data and also use `metric`.
* You can explicitly set `X` to NULL, as long as you don't try and use an
initialization method that makes use of `X` (`init = "pca"` or `init = "spca"`).
* You *can* transform new data by setting `ret_model = TRUE`. You must provide 
`umap_transform` with the distances between new data and the original data via
its `nn_method` parameter.

Here's an example of using pre-computed nearest neighbor data using the
even-numbered observations in `iris` to build an initial model and then
transforming the odd-numbered observations. This relies on some internal `uwot`
functions which I do not promise have a stable API (i.e. this may example may be
broken when you read this), but it gives you the general idea:

```R
iris_even <- iris[seq(2, nrow(iris), 2), ]
iris_odd <- iris[seq(1, nrow(iris), 2), ]

iris_even_nn <- uwot:::annoy_nn(
  X = uwot:::x2m(iris_even),
  k = 15,
  metric = "euclidean",
  ret_index = TRUE
)

iris_odd_nn <- annoy_search(
  X = uwot:::x2m(iris_odd),
  k = 15,
  ann = iris_even_nn$index
)

# Delete the Annoy index, force the transform method to use the nn distances 
# directly
iris_even_nn$index <- NULL

iris_even_umap <-
  umap(
    X = NULL,
    nn_method = iris_even_nn,
    ret_model = TRUE
  )

iris_odd_transform <-
  umap_transform(X = NULL, iris_even_umap, nn_method = iris_odd_nn)
```

### Exporting nearest neighbor data from `uwot`

If you set `ret_nn = TRUE`, the return value of `umap` will be a list, and the
`nn` item contains the nearest neighbor data in a format that can be used
with `nn_method`. This is handy if you are going to be running UMAP multiple
times with the same data and `n_neighbors` and `scale` settings, because the
nearest neighbor calculation can be the most time-consuming part of the
calculation.

Normally the contents of `nn` is itself a list, the value of which is the
nearest neighbor data. The name is the type of metric that generated the data.
As an example, here's what the first few items of the `iris` 5-NN data should
look like:

```R
lapply(umap(iris, ret_nn = TRUE, n_neighbors = 5)$nn$euclidean, head)

$`idx`
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1   18    5   40   29
[2,]    2   35   46   13   10
[3,]    3   48    4    7   13
[4,]    4   48   30   31    3
[5,]    5   38    1   18   41
[6,]    6   19   11   49   45

$dist
     [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]      [,5]
[1,]    0 0.1000000 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1414214
[2,]    0 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1732051
[3,]    0 0.1414214 0.2449490 0.2645751 0.2645751
[4,]    0 0.1414214 0.1732051 0.2236068 0.2449490
[5,]    0 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1732051 0.1732051
[6,]    0 0.3316625 0.3464102 0.3605551 0.3741657
```

If for some reason you specify `ret_nn` while supplying precomputed nearest
neighbor data to `nn_method`, the returned data should be identical to what
you passed in, and the list item names will be `precomputed`.

### Multiple neighbor data

As discussed under the
[Mixed Data Types](https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot#mixed-data-types) section,
you can apply multiple distance metrics to different parts of matrix or
data frame input data. if you do this, then `ret_nn` will return all the
neighbor data. The list under `nn` will now contain as many items as metrics,
in the order they were specified. For instance, if the `metric` argument is:

```R
metric = list("euclidean" = c("Petal.Width", "Petal.Length"),
              "cosine" = c("Sepal.Width", "Sepal.Length"))
```

The `nn` list will contain two list entries. The first will be called
`euclidean` and the second `cosine`.

If you have access to multiple distance metrics, you may also provide multiple
precomputed neighbor data to `nn_method` in the same format: a list of lists,
where each sublist has the same format as described above (i.e. the two
matrices, `idx` and `dist`). The names of the list items are ignored, so you
don't need to set them. Roughly, do something like this:

```R
nn_metric1 <- list(idx = matrix(...), dist = matrix(...))
nn_metric2 <- list(idx = matrix(...), dist = matrix(...))
umap_res <- umap(nn_method = list(nn_metric1, nn_metric2), ...)
```

The different neighbor data must all have the same number of neighbors, i.e.
the number of columns in all the matrices must be the same.

### Numeric `y`

If you are using supervised UMAP with a numeric `y`, then you can also pass
nearest neighbor data to `y`, using the same format as above. In this case the
nearest neighbors should be with respect to the data in `y`.

Note that you *cannot* pass categorical `y` as nearest neighbor data. This is
because the processing of the data goes through a different code path that
doesn't directly calculate nearest neighbors: if `y` is a factor, when there
are only a small number of levels, the number of neighbors of an item can be
vastly larger than `n_neighbors`.

Nearest neighbor data for `y` is not returned from `umap` for re-use.
