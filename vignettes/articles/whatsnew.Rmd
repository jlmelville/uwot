title: "What's New"
---

A place for me to put the old less-structured updates that I post at the top of
the `README.md` file for the package. When they aren't new any more, they will
get moved here. You should look at the
[Changelog](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/news/index.html) for fuller 
details.

*April 21 2024* As ordained by prophecy, version 0.2.2 of `uwot` has been
released to CRAN. `RSpectra` is back as a main dependency and I *thought* I had
worked out a clever scheme to avoid the failures seen in some installations with
the `irlba`/`Matrix` interactions. This releases fixes the problem on all the
systems I have access to (including GitHub Actions CI) but some CRAN checks
remain failing. How embarrassing. That said, if you have had issues, it's
possible this new release will help you too.

*April 18 2024* Version 0.2.1 of `uwot` has been released to CRAN. Some features 
to be aware of: [RcppHNSW](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnndescent) and
[rnndescent](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnndescent) are now supported as
optional dependencies. If you install and load them, you can use them as an
alternative to RcppAnnoy in the nearest neighbor search and should be faster.
Also, a new `umap2` function has been added, with updated defaults compared to
`umap`. Please see the updated and new articles on
[HNSW](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/hnsw-umap.html), 
[rnndescent](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/rnndescent-umap.html),
[working with sparse data](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/sparse-data-example.html)
and [umap2](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/umap2.html). I consider
this worthy of moving from `0.1.x` to `0.2.x`, but in the interests of full
disclosure, on-going
[irlba problems](https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/115) has caused a
CRAN check failure, so we might be onto 0.2.2 sooner than I'd like.

*November 26 2023* Happy 1 million CRAN downloads to `uwot`. To celebrate 
(actually it's just a coincidence) I have reorganized the horror-show that was
the sprawling README into actual articles, via the fantastic
[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) package. Find it at
<https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/>.

*June 28 2023* Version 0.1.16 has been released to CRAN. This is a very minor
tweak to 0.1.15 to further support the new release of [RcppAnnoy](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy).

*June 28 2023* Version 0.1.16 has been released to CRAN. This is a very minor
tweak to 0.1.15 to further support the new release of 
[RcppAnnoy](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy).

*June 26 2023* Version 0.1.15 has been released to CRAN. This is to support a
new release of [RcppAnnoy](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy), but
there are also some bug fixes and other minor improvements. There are some new
functions: `optimize_graph_layout` will carry out the UMAP optimization
step on a sparse similiarity matrix, e.g. the output of `similarity_graph`.
`simplicial_set_union` and `simplicial_set_intersect` provide ways to merge 
different views of the same data into one sparse similiarity matrix. As usual,
`NEWS.md` has all the details.

*August 22 2022* Just when you least expected it, version 0.1.14 has been 
released to CRAN (the `NEWS` file on CRAN calls it `0.1.13.9000` because I
forgot to update that file, but let's keep that amongst ourselves). This release
includes a bug fix for `umap_transform` when you use external nearest neighbors
and new function `similarity_graph`, to support extracting just the high
dimensional fuzzy simplicial set.

*August 16 2022* Version 0.1.13 has been released to CRAN (0.1.12 was a failed
submission). Among other things you can now pass your own nearest neighbors data
in sparse matrix form. Also there is an option to reproduce relative cluster
density by
[approximating the densMAP method](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/leopold.html).
See the [NEWS](https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/blob/master/NEWS.md#uwot-0113)
page for more.

*December 12 2021* Version 0.1.11 has been released to CRAN. It is now possible
to get reproducible results (for a given value of `set.seed`) when running
the optimization step with multiple threads (`n_sgd_threads` greater than 1).
You may need to increase `n_epochs` to get similar levels of convergence. To run
in this mode, set `batch = TRUE`. Thanks to [Aaron Lun](https://github.com/LTLA)
who came up with the design for this and also implemented it in his 
[umappp C++ library](https://github.com/libscran/umappp). See `NEWS.md` for
other changes.

*December 15 2020* Version 0.1.10 has been released to CRAN. This is mainly
to maintain compatibility with RcppAnnoy, but also a small change was made to
avoid it grinding away pointlessly in the presence of `NA` values, based on
an observation by David McGaughey on Twitter (which I can no longer link to).

*November 15 2020* Version 0.1.9 has been released to CRAN. The main addition is
support for the Pearson correlation. Also, a slight license change from GPL-3
to GPL-3 or later.

*August 1 2020* New metric supported: Pearson correlation (with 
`metric = "correlation"`). This should give similar results to the Python UMAP
(and sklearn) implementation of the `correlation` metric.

*March 16 2020* A new version (0.1.8) is on CRAN. This is a minor release in terms of
features, but you can now export the UMAP graph (<https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/47>),
and there are some bug fixes for: loading Annoy indexes
(<https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/31>), reproducibility across platforms
(<https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/46>) and we no longer use RcppParallel for the
multi-threading support, which should lead to fewer installation problems.

*March 4 2020* I had to cancel my submission of version 0.1.7 to CRAN because of
a broken example in a library using uwot. In the mean time I have switched to
using `std::thread` rather than tinythread++.

*March 1 2020* Version 0.1.6 was rejected from CRAN due to undefined behavior
issues that originate from RcppAnnoy and RcppParallel. I am hopeful that the
Annoy behavior is fixed and a suitable version of RcppAnnoy will be released
onto CRAN eventually. The RcppParallel issues originate with the use of
[tbb](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) and seems much harder to deal with. As there
is no way to use RcppParallel without tbb yet, I am temporarily replacing the
use of RcppParallel with just a subset of the code needed to run parallel for
loops with the [tinythread++](https://tinythreadpp.bitsnbites.eu/) library.

*December 4 2019* Version 0.1.5 released on CRAN. This fixes a couple of crash
bugs, including one where the R API was being called from inside a thread. This
may have been causing the issues seen by users of
[monocle](https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3/issues/186)
and [seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/2256).

*September 23 2019* Version 0.1.4 released on CRAN. This ensures compatibility
with RcppAnnoy 0.0.13 when using `load_uwot`.

*April 6 2019*. uwot is now on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=uwot).
Also, some minor-to-horrible bugs in the `lvish` perplexity routine have been
fixed.

For visualization purposes, it seems reasonable to use the old PRNG
(`pcg_rand = FALSE`), along with multiple threads during SGD
(`n_sgd_threads = "auto"`), and the UMAP gradient approximation
(`approx_pow = TRUE`), which combined will show a very noticeable speed up
during optimization. I have added a new parameter, `fast_sgd`, which if set to
`TRUE`, sets these options for you.
