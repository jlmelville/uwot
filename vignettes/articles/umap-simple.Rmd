title: "UMAP on some simple datasets"
---

The distill publication 
[How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) provides
some interactive examples of t-SNE on a variety of simple datasets and
demonstrates the effect of changing its hyperparameters, mainly the perplexity,
which acts like a continuous version of the `n_neighbors` parameter in UMAP.

Below, I will repeat some results using UMAP instead of t-SNE, which might
highlight some differences between the two methods. Sadly, there won't be any
fancy in-browser interactive demos.

The datasets used in the distill publication are available translated to R in
the [snedata](https://github.com/jlmelville/snedata) package.

UMAP results are all run with the `n_neighbors` parameter set to match the 
`perplexity` used in t-SNE all other parameters left at their default values.
There are two minor exceptions: in UMAP, a point is a neighbor of itself, 
which isn't the case with perplexity. This doesn't make much difference for
large perplexities, but for the low perplexity values of 2 and 5, I use
`n_neighbors = 3` and `n_neighbors = 6`, respectively.

I won't repeat the t-SNE results here. You should refer back to the distill
page to compare. I have kept the same order of datasets and used the same colors
so it should be straightforward to keep things tracked.

## Grid

A 2D grid with regularly spaced points.

```R
grid2d <- snedata::grid_data(n = 20)
```

Like t-SNE, UMAP tends to expand denser regions of data, so there is a bigger
gap between points in the middle of the grid.

## 2 Clusters

Two 2D Gaussian clusters of equal variance, and 50 points each.

```R
gauss2d <- snedata::two_clusters_data(n = 50, dim = 2)
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![gauss2d orig](img/simple/gauss2d_orig.png)|![gauss2d nbrs3](img/simple/gauss2d_nbrs3.png)|![gauss2d nbrs6](img/simple/gauss2d_nbrs6.png)
![gauss2d nbrs30](img/simple/gauss2d_nbrs30.png)|![gauss2d nbrs50](img/simple/gauss2d_nbrs50.png)|![gauss2d nbrs100](img/simple/gauss2d_nbrs100.png)

Setting `n_neighbors` too low clearly gives results which are too local.

## Cluster Densities

In this example, one of the clusters (the yellow one) is much denser (and hence
smaller) than the other.

```R
gauss2d_scale <- snedata::two_different_clusters_data(n = 75, scale = 10, dim = 2)
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![gauss_scale orig](img/simple/gauss_scale_orig.png)|![gauss_scale nbrs3](img/simple/gauss_scale_nbrs3.png)|![gauss_scale nbrs6](img/simple/gauss_scale_nbrs6.png)
![gauss_scale nbrs30](img/simple/gauss_scale_nbrs30.png)|![gauss_scale nbrs50](img/simple/gauss_scale_nbrs50.png)|![gauss_scale nbrs100](img/simple/gauss_scale_nbrs100.png)

Again like t-SNE, UMAP does not reproduce the relative cluster densities.

## Cluster Size

```R
x100a <- snedata::gaussian_data(n = 100, dim = 50, color = "blue")
x1000b <- snedata::gaussian_data(n = 1000, dim = 50, color = "orange")
x1000b[, 1:50] <- x1000b[, 1:50] <- x1000b[, 1:50] + 10
x200 <- rbind(x100a, x100b)
x1100 <- rbind(x100a, x1000b)
```

As an aside, what about two clusters with the same density but different numbers
of points? Below is an example with two clusters with equal sizes (100 points 
each), and then where the orange cluster contains 1000 points:

| |
|:--:|:--:
![100 blue 100 orange](img/simple/100_blue_100_orange.png)|![100 blue 1000 orange](img/simple/100_blue_1000_orange.png)

From this example you can see that UMAP will display clusters with more members
as being larger. This can have implications for the visualization if you have a 
minority class that you are most interested in.

## Distances Between Clusters

In this example, we are back to gaussians with the same variances, but now
one of them (the green one) is much further away than the other two.

```R
gauss_3clusters <- snedata::three_clusters_data(n = 50, dim = 2)
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![gauss3 orig](img/simple/gauss3_orig.png)|![gauss3 nbrs3](img/simple/gauss3_nbrs3.png)|![gauss3 nbrs6](img/simple/gauss3_nbrs6.png)
![gauss3 nbrs30](img/simple/gauss3_nbrs30.png)|![gauss3 nbrs50](img/simple/gauss3_nbrs50.png)|![gauss3 nbrs100](img/simple/gauss3_nbrs100.png)

There's not really any value of `n_neighbors` where the correct relative
distances are reproduced. On the other hand, at least we don't see any strange
distortion of the size of the green cluster at high values for `n_neighbors`,
where as the t-SNE results start showing distortions at high perplexity.

We then repeat with a larger number of points in each cluster:

```R
gauss_3clusters200 <- snedata::three_clusters_data(n = 200, dim = 2)
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![gauss3 200 orig](img/simple/gauss3_200_orig.png)|![gauss3 200 nbrs3](img/simple/gauss3_200_nbrs3.png)|![gauss3 200 nbrs6](img/simple/gauss3_200_nbrs6.png)
![gauss3 200 nbrs30](img/simple/gauss3_200_nbrs30.png)|![gauss3 200 nbrs50](img/simple/gauss3_200_nbrs50.png)|![gauss3 200 nbrs100](img/simple/gauss3_200_nbrs100.png)

Results are very consistent with a sensible value of `n_neighbors`, but it's 
clear that UMAP does not reproduce relative distances in this case.

## Random Noise

A single high-dimensional Guassian:

```R
gauss100d <- snedata::gaussian_data(n = 500, dim = 100, color = "#003399")
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![gauss100 orig](img/simple/gauss100_orig.png)|![gauss100 nbrs3](img/simple/gauss100_nbrs3.png)|![gauss100 nbrs6](img/simple/gauss100_nbrs6.png)
![gauss100 nbrs30](img/simple/gauss100_nbrs30.png)|![gauss100 nbrs50](img/simple/gauss100_nbrs50.png)|![gauss100 nbrs100](img/simple/gauss100_nbrs100.png)

Again, we see t-SNE-like behavior: the density of points in the projection
is more even than the linear projection provided by PCA. It's also clear that
low values of `n_neighbors` could mislead you into seeing large numbers of 
small clusters that aren't really there.

## Elongated Shapes

An ellipsoidal cluster:

```R
gauss_long <- snedata::long_gaussian_data(n = 100, dim = 50, color = "#003399")
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![gauss long orig](img/simple/gauss_long_orig.png)|![gauss long nbrs3](img/simple/gauss_long_nbrs3.png)|![gauss long nbrs6](img/simple/gauss_long_nbrs6.png)
![gauss long nbrs30](img/simple/gauss_long_nbrs30.png)|![gauss long nbrs50](img/simple/gauss_long_nbrs50.png)|![gauss long nbrs100](img/simple/gauss_long_nbrs100.png)

Once again, UMAP behaves pretty well here as long as `n_neighbors` is 
sufficiently high.

Now, here are two ellipsoidal clusters:

```R
gauss_2long <- snedata::long_cluster_data(n = 75)
```
| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![gauss 2long orig](img/simple/gauss_2long_orig.png)|![gauss 2long nbrs3](img/simple/gauss_2long_nbrs3.png)|![gauss 2long nbrs6](img/simple/gauss_2long_nbrs6.png)
![gauss 2long nbrs30](img/simple/gauss_2long_nbrs30.png)|![gauss 2long nbrs50](img/simple/gauss_2long_nbrs50.png)|![gauss 2long nbrs100](img/simple/gauss_2long_nbrs100.png)

The density distortion effect is also apparent here, causing the clusters to 
curve. 

## Topology

### Containment

In this dataset, there are two 50D gaussian clusters, centered over the same 
location, but as the PCA plot on the top left row shows, the blue cluster has
a much smaller variance and so is "contained" inside the yellow cluster.

```R
subset50d <- snedata::subset_clusters_data(n = 75, dim = 50)
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![subset orig](img/simple/subset_orig.png)|![subset nbrs3](img/simple/subset_nbrs3.png)|![subset nbrs6](img/simple/subset_nbrs6.png)
![subset nbrs30](img/simple/subset_nbrs30.png)|![subset nbrs50](img/simple/subset_nbrs50.png)|![subset nbrs100](img/simple/subset_nbrs100.png)

At last a difference with the t-SNE results. With t-SNE, the containment 
relationship can be displayed with a suitable choice of perplexity, at the cost
of the yellow cluster gaining a more ring-like shape. UMAP, however, stubbornly
refuses to show anything of the sort, with the blue cluster expanded to overlap
the yellow cluster even at the higher values of `n_neighbors`.

### Linked Rings

2D linked rings, embedding into 3D (one is at right angles to the other).

```R
linked_rings <- snedata::link_data(n = 100)
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![link orig](img/simple/link_orig.png)|![link nbrs3](img/simple/link_nbrs3.png)|![link nbrs6](img/simple/link_nbrs6.png)
![link nbrs30](img/simple/link_nbrs30.png)|![link nbrs50](img/simple/link_nbrs50.png)|![link nbrs100](img/simple/link_nbrs100.png)

The t-SNE results show the rings between separate at low perplexity, and only
linked at high perplexities. The UMAP results are always unlinked except at a
very low value of `n_neighbors`, and even then this seems to be an artifact of
the number of epochs and the random seed. If you set `n_epochs` higher, then the
rings will be invariably unlinked.

### Trefoil Knot

```R
trefoil <- snedata::trefoil_data(n = 150)
```

| | | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:
![trefoil orig](img/simple/trefoil_orig.png)|![trefoil nbrs3](img/simple/trefoil_nbrs3.png)|![trefoil nbrs6](img/simple/trefoil_nbrs6.png)
![trefoil nbrs30](img/simple/trefoil_nbrs30.png)|![trefoil nbrs50](img/simple/trefoil_nbrs50.png)|![trefoil nbrs100](img/simple/trefoil_nbrs100.png)

Results here are quite similar to the t-SNE results. At low values of
`n_neighbors`, the knot is unfolded into a circle, and at higher values, the
folded form appears. As with the linked rings, the results you get at
low values of `n_neighbors` are more consistent at higher values of `n_epochs`.

What are we to make of all this? Mainly, that the UMAP results are a bit more
consistent than that of t-SNE, in the sense that changing `n_neighbors` doesn't
lead to very different results in the way that changing `perplexity` does for
t-SNE, although these effects are mainly restricted to the three cluster and
the containment example. You may see this as an advantage to t-SNE. Personally,
I am a bit skeptical that you would see this sort of thing in real world 
datasets.

It's also worth noting that, like t-SNE: 

* Inter-cluster distances are not reproduced.
* Relative cluster sizes are not reproduced.
* Denser regions of space are expanded more than less dense parts.
