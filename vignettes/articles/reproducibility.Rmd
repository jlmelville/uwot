title: "Reproducibility"
---

`uwot` relies on the underlying compiler and C++ standard library on your
machine and this can result in differences in output even with the same input
data, arguments, packages and R version. If you require reproducibility between
machines, it is strongly suggested that you stick with the same OS and compiler
version on all of them (e.g. a fixed LTS of a Linux distro and gcc version).
Otherwise, the following can help:

* Use the `tumap` method instead of `umap`. This avoid the use of `std::pow` in
gradient calculations. This also has the advantage of being faster to optimize.
However, this gives larger clusters in the output, and you don't have the 
ability to control that with `a` and `b` (or `spread` and `min_dist`)
parameters.
* For `umap`, it's better to provide `a` and `b` directly with a fixed precision
rather than allowing them to be calculated via the `spread` and `min_dist`
parameters. For default UMAP, use `a = 1.8956, b = 0.8006`.
* Use `approx_pow = TRUE`, which avoids the use of the `std::pow` function.
* Use `init = "spca"` rather than `init = "spectral"` (although the latter is 
the default and preferred method for UMAP initialization).
* If `n_sgd_threads` is set larger than `1`, then even if you use `set.seed`,
results of the embeddings are not repeatable, This is because there is no
locking carried out on the underlying coordinate matrix, and work is partitioned
by edge not vertex and a given vertex may be processed by different threads. The
order in which reads and writes occur is of course at the whim of the thread
scheduler. This is the same behavior as LargeVis.
* Use `rng_type = "deterministic`, which will make vertex sampling during the
optimization deterministic. Note that this will *not* affect the use of a random
number generator in other parts of the algorithm, such as approximate nearest
neighbor search and initialization. This may give slightly less accurate results
due to the lack of random sampling but the trade-off may be worth it (and it's
also a bit faster).
* For random number generation, you can provide a `seed` parameter. This doesn't
do anything other than call `set.seed` for you inside the routine, but you may
find it convenient to fix the seed in the call to `umap`.

In summary, your chances of reproducibility are increased by using:

```R
mnist_umap <- umap(mnist, a = 1.8956, b = 0.8006, approx_pow = TRUE, init = "spca", batch = TRUE, rng_type = "deterministic", seed = 42)
# or
mnist_tumap <- tumap(mnist, init = "spca", batch = TRUE, rng_type = "deterministic", seed = 42)
```
