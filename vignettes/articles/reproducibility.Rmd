title: "Reproducibility"
---

`uwot` relies on the underlying compiler and C++ standard library on your
machine and this can result in differences in output even with the same input
data, arguments, packages and R version. If you require reproducibility between
machines, it is strongly suggested that you stick with the same OS and compiler
version on all of them (e.g. a fixed LTS of a Linux distro and gcc version).
Otherwise, the following can help:

* Use the `tumap` method instead of `umap`. This avoid the use of `std::pow` in
gradient calculations. This also has the advantage of being faster to optimize.
However, this gives larger clusters in the output, and you don't have the 
ability to control that with `a` and `b` (or `spread` and `min_dist`)
parameters.
* For `umap`, it's better to provide `a` and `b` directly with a fixed precision
rather than allowing them to be calculated via the `spread` and `min_dist`
parameters. For default UMAP, use `a = 1.8956, b = 0.8006`.
* Use `approx_pow = TRUE`, which avoids the use of the `std::pow` function.
* Use `init = "spca"` rather than `init = "spectral"` (although the latter is 
the default and preferred method for UMAP initialization).

In summary, your chances of reproducibility are increased by using:

```R
mnist_umap <- umap(mnist, a = 1.8956, b = 0.8006, approx_pow = TRUE, init = "spca")
# or
mnist_tumap <- tumap(mnist, init = "spca")
```
