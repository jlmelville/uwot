title: "t-UMAP"
---

If you choose the UMAP curve parameters to be `a = 1` and `b = 1`, you get
back the Cauchy distribution used in
[t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/)
and [LargeVis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00370). This also happens to
significantly simplify the gradient leading to a noticeable speed-up: for MNIST,
I saw the optimization time drop from 66 seconds to 18 seconds. The trade off is
that you will see larger, more spread-out clusters than with the typical UMAP
settings (they're still more compact than you see in t-SNE, however). To try
t-UMAP, use the `tumap` function:

```R
mnist_tumap <- tumap(mnist, n_neighbors = 15, verbose = TRUE)
```

Note that using `umap(a = 1, b = 1)` doesn't use the simplified gradient, so
you won't see any speed-up that way.

Some examples comparing UMAP and t-UMAP are in the
[examples](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/umap-examples.html)
article.
