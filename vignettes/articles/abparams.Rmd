This is part of the documentation for [uwot](https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot).

If you look at the UMAP 
[examples](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/umap-examples.html), it's clear
that the default settings aren't always appropriate for some datasets: it's
easy to get results where the clusters are very spaced out relative to their
sizes, which makes viewing your data on a single static plot quite difficult
compared to t-SNE. Fortunately, UMAP's output weight function can be adjusted
to give different results.

Note that another way to change UMAP's output is to modify the value of 
`n_neighbors`. This is a more drastic change that directly modifies the input
affinity graph we are trying to find a low-dimensional approximation to, and it 
can have a big effect on run-time, so we won't consider that here. Changes to
the output weight function are more subtle.

## Theory

The output weight between two points $i$ and $j$ are given by:

$$
w_{ij} = 1 / \left(1 + ad_{ij}^{2b}\right)
$$

with $d_{ij}$ being the Euclidean distance in the embedding between the two
points. Below I drop the $ij$ subscript for clarity's sake. $a$ and $b$ are two
hyper-parameters. Usually they are determined by a non-linear least squares fit
based on an exponential decay curve parameterized by `min_dist` and `spread`:

$$
w = \exp\left[-\max \left(0, d - \rho \right) / \sigma \right]
$$

where `min_dist` is $\rho$ and `spread` is $\sigma$. I have used those symbols
to make it more obvious that this equation has the same form as UMAP's weighting
function for its edge weights in the input space. As a reminder, the presence of
the `max` operation and shifting the distances by $\rho$ is to enforce the local
connectivity constraint: there is always an edge weight of 1 between a point and
its nearest neighbor. `spread` determines the x-value range over which the
y-value decays to zero, and is set to `spread` multiplied by 3. 

Here's some R code that works through this and then plots the results using
the Python UMAP defaults of `spread = 1`, `min_dist = 0.1`:

```R
spread <- 1
min_dist <- 0.1

# define the exponential
xv <- seq(
  from = 0,
  to = spread * 3,
  length.out = 300
)
yv <- exp(-(pmax(0, xv - min_dist)) / spread)

# Fit the a,b curve to the exponential
params <- stats::nls(yv ~ 1 / (1 + a * xv^(2.0 * b)),
  start = list(a = 1, b = 1)
)$m$getPars()
a <- params["a"]
b <- params["b"]

# Plot the results
title <-
  paste0(
    "exp curve spread = ",
    spread,
    ", min_dist = ",
    min_dist
  )
sub <-
  paste0("UMAP fit (green) a = ", formatC(a), " b = ", formatC(b))
plot(
  xv,
  yv,
  xlab = "d",
  ylab = "w",
  type = "l",
  main = title,
  lwd = 2
)

graphics::mtext(sub)
lines(xv, 1 / (1 + a * xv^(2.0 * b)), col = "#1B9E77FF", lwd = 2)
```

![UMAP a,b curve](img/abparams/umap_ab_curve.png)

As the title indicates, this curve leads to the default parameters of 
$a = 1.577$, $b = 0.895$. `uwot` uses a slightly different default `min_dist =
0.001`, which leads to $a = 1.93, b = 0.79$. I don't know why I used a different
default `min_dist` -- probably I made a mistake. This is likely to change in a
later version of `uwot`, but it doesn't make much of a difference to the
results, fortunately. Setting $a = 1, b = 1$ gives the Cauchy distribution used
in t-SNE (and the `tumap` function in `uwot`), which corresponds roughly to
`spread = 1.12` and `min_dist = 0.23`: putting those values back into the
curve-fitting routine will give you back $a = 0.99$, $b = 1.01$. Close enough.
Here is the `uwot` default results in orange and the Cauchy results in blue
overlaid with the UMAP defaults (green, same as in the previous plot):

![Other UMAP a,b curve](img/abparams/umap_ab_curve_other.png)

This still leaves open the question of how changing `spread` and `min_dist`, or
`a` and `b` affects the output of UMAP. The current version of the 
[UMAP docs](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html) doesn't
mention `spread` and treats `min_dist` as the only adjustable parameter, which
can be varied between `0` and very close to `1`. But in what follows we'll take
a look at both `min_dist` and `spread`, and use the trusty MNIST digits dataset 
to investigate their effect.

## min_dist and spread

Let's look at `min_dist` and `spread` first. First, I'll show some results of
changing `spread`, keeping `min_dist = 0.1` and then we'll look at changing
`min_dist`, while fixing `spread = 1`. The above explanation of the exponential
curve suggests that allowing `min_dist` to exceed the value of `spread` will
give increasingly odd results.

### spread

In the plots below, the value of `spread` and `min_dist` is given in the title,
along with the values of `a` and `b` that they give rise to. The value of
`spread` increases from 0.1 to 10 as we go from left to right and top to bottom.

|                             |                           |                           |
:----------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:
![spread = 0.1](img/abparams/mnist_s0.1d0.1.png)|![spread = 0.5](img/abparams/mnist_s0.5d0.1.png)|![spread = 0.75](img/abparams/mnist_s0.75d0.1.png)
![spread = 1](img/abparams/mnist_s1d0.1.png)|![spread = 1.5](img/abparams/mnist_s1.5d0.1.png)|![spread = 2](img/abparams/mnist_s2d0.1.png)
![spread = 3](img/abparams/mnist_s3d0.1.png)|![spread = 5](img/abparams/mnist_s5d0.1.png)|![spread = 10](img/abparams/mnist_s10d0.1.png)

The top-left result, with `spread = min_dist = 0.1` gives a clear indication 
that you want `spread` to be larger than `min_dist`. Then, for values of
`spread` between 0.5-3 not much happens. As `spread` gets to 5 and above,
the clusters start to overlap each other.

Here's a table summarizing how `a` and `b` change as `spread` is varied.

|spread|min_dist|a|b|
-------|--------|-|-|
0.1|0.1|830|1.93
0.5|0.1|5.07|1.00
0.75|0.1|2.51|0.93
1|0.1|1.58|0.90
1.5|0.1|0.84|0.86
2|0.1|0.54|0.84
3|0.1|0.30|0.82
5|0.1|0.14|0.81
10|0.1|0.05|0.80

For low values of `spread`, `a` starts getting very large.

What about `min_dist`? Below, `min_dist` increases from 0.0001 to 2, with
`spread = 1`, so I suspect the highest of these values will also show some
eccentric results.

### min_dist

|                             |                           |                           |
:----------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:
![min_dist = 0.0001](img/abparams/mnist_s1d0.0001.png)|![min_dist = 0.001](img/abparams/mnist_s1d0.001.png)|![min_dist = 0.01](img/abparams/mnist_s1d0.01.png)
![min_dist = 0.05](img/abparams/mnist_s1d0.05.png)|![min_dist = 0.1](img/abparams/mnist_s1d0.1.png)|![min_dist = 0.5](img/abparams/mnist_s1d0.5.png)
![min_dist = 1](img/abparams/mnist_s1d1.png)|![min_dist = 1.5](img/abparams/mnist_s1d1.5.png)|![min_dist = 2](img/abparams/mnist_s1d2.png)


Again, there is a range of `min_dist` values, from 0.0001 to 0.1 where not much
happens to the plot. Above this value, the clusters begin to expand. The final
shapes are very diffuse. The table below shows how `a` and `b` change as 
`min_dist` increases.

|spread|min_dist|a|b|
-------|--------|-|-|
1|0.0001|1.932|0.791
1|0.001|1.929|0.792
1|0.01|1.90|0.80
1|0.05|1.75|0.84
1|0.1|1.58|0.90
1|0.5|0.58|1.33
1|1|0.12|1.93
1|1.5|0.013|2.67
1|2|0.0004|3.89

For value of `min_dist` larger than 0.5, values of `a` drop quickly while 
`b` increases rapidly.

In terms of the differences between `spread` and `min_dist`, `min_dist` seems
to more obviously increase the size of the clusters, whereas increasing 
`spread` keeps the shape and boundary of the clusters a bit better. `spread`
can therefore be used to control the inter-cluster distances to some extent,
where as `min_dist` controls the size of the clusters.

## a and b

Rather than change `spread` and `min_dist`, we can supply values of `a` and `b`
directly. Perhaps these can also be interpreted. Again, we'll look at changing
each value separately, leaving the other value at the UMAP defaults (`a = 1.58`
and `b = 0.90`). I used the range of values of `a` and `b` that resulted from
changing `min_dist` and `spread` in the previous section's results to set
the range of values I look at below.

[Wang and co-workers](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-1061.html) recommend
that `b > 0.5` to be a good loss function for dimensionality reduction (see
Proposition 1 and 2 in their PaCMAP paper).

### a

`a` seemed to have a wider range of values than `b`, so I looked at values 
between `a = 0.0001` and `a = 100`.

|                             |                           |                           |
:----------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:
![a = 0.0001](img/abparams/mnist_a0.0001b0.9.png)|![a = 0.001](img/abparams/mnist_a0.001b0.9.png)|![a = 0.01](img/abparams/mnist_a0.01b0.9.png)
![a = 0.1](img/abparams/mnist_a0.1b0.9.png)|![a = 1](img/abparams/mnist_a1b0.9.png)|![a = 2](img/abparams/mnist_a2b0.9.png)
![a = 10](img/abparams/mnist_a10b0.9.png)|![a = 50](img/abparams/mnist_a50b0.9.png)|![a = 100](img/abparams/mnist_a100b0.9.png)

`a` seems to control the spread of the clusters for most of its range. Low
values of `a` certainly result in a diffuse round cloud. Above `a = 10`, I
suspect we are running into numerical issues with taking a large power of a
small positive value. Values between 0.1 and 10 seem reasonable, with higher
values leading to smaller clusters.


### b

`b` definitely seems to have a smaller range of useful values compared to `a`, 
so I looked at values between `b = 0.1` to `b = 2.5`.

|                             |                           |                           |
:----------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:
![b = 0.1](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b0.1.png)|![b = 0.25](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b0.25.png)|![b = 0.5](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b0.5.png)
![b = 0.75](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b0.75.png)|![b = 1](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b1.png)|![b = 1.25](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b1.25.png)
![b = 1.5](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b1.5.png)|![b = 2](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b2.png)|![b = 2.5](img/abparams/mnist_a1.58b2.5.png)

`b` seems to work like the heavy-tail parameter sometimes used in 
[t-SNE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05804): low values increase the distances
between the clusters, relative to their size, but also reveal sub-clusters that 
appear to be one structure in the other plots. At high values, the space between
clusters is reduced, but you can still see borders between the clusters, unlike
what happens with low `a`.

I don't see a big difference between using `a` and `b` directly, or sticking
with `min_dist` and `spread` I prefer `a` and `b` myself, as it reminds me
more of the approach used in 
[ABSNE (PDF)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/papers/2015-ICML-absne.pdf),
although I don't claim there is any equivalence between the `a` and `b`
parameters in UMAP and the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters in that work.

## Examples

MNIST is useful for seeing the effect of changing `a` and `b`, but it can be 
visualized well with the default parameters. So here are two examples which
show that we can improve on the default visualizations, by using our knowledge
of what `a` and `b` roughly represent in terms of cluster size and separation.

### Example 1: tasic2018

The transcriptomics dataset tasic2018 is a good example where the default UMAP
parameters are sub-optimal. Below is the default UMAP result in the top left
image, and then a series of results based on me fiddling with `a` and `b` in
response to it. I eventually fumble my way to a setting with a lower `a` and
a higher `b` that provides a better visualization (in my opinion), which you
can see in the lower right.

|                             |                           |
:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:
![a = 1.58 b = 0.9](img/abparams/tasic2018_a1.58b0.9.png)|![a = 1 b = 0.9](img/abparams/tasic2018_a1b0.9.png)
![a = 1 b = 1.5](img/abparams/tasic2018_a1b1.5.png)|![a = 0.5 b = 1.5](img/abparams/tasic2018_a0.5b1.5.png)

### Example 2: COIL-20

And here's another example where arguably the default UMAP results spread the
clusters out a bit too much. Here are three alternatives based on controlling
`a` and `b`.

|                             |                           |
:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:
![a = 1.58 b = 0.9](img/abparams/coil20_a1.58b0.9.png)|![a = 0.1 b = 0.9](img/abparams/coil20_a0.1b0.9.png)
![a = 0.5 b = 0.9](img/abparams/coil20_a0.5b0.9.png)|![a = 0.5 b = 1.1](img/abparams/coil20_a0.5b1.1.png)

## My recommendation

Hopefully this is enough to convince you that the embedding parameters can be
profitably twiddled with in more than a random way to give visualizations that 
improve over the default settings. 

Of `min_dist` and `spread`, modifying `min_dist` between 0 and 1, as suggested
by the UMAP docs seems to be most fruitful of the parameters to meddle with.

I personally prefer to use `a` and `b` directly. To find good values for `a` and
`b`, you can start with them at `a = 1 and b = 1`, which gives a t-SNE-like
output function, and you can use the `tumap` function to generate the initial
plot much faster. I also recommend doing any PCA dimensionality reduction
outside of `uwot` and using `ret_nn = TRUE` for the first plot, so you can
re-use the nearest neighbors data in subsequent runs of `umap`. This is a
substantial speed up and makes repeating runs with different values of `a` and
`b` a lot more tolerable.

Here's an example workflow:

```R
# PCA to 50 dimensions first
mnist_pca <- irlba::prcomp_irlba(mnist, n = 50, retx = TRUE, center = center,
                             scale = FALSE)$x

# t-UMAP is equivalent to a = 1, b = 1
# remember to get the nearest neighbor data back too
mnist_a1b1 <- tumap(mnist_pca, ret_nn = TRUE)

# find a
mnist_a1.5b1 <- umap(mnist_pca, nn_method = mnist_a1b1$nn, a = 1.5, b = 1)
mnist_a0.5b1 <- umap(mnist_pca, nn_method = mnist_a1b1$nn, a = 0.5, b = 1)

# find b based on whichever value of a you prefer
mnist_a0.5b1.2 <- umap(mnist_pca, nn_method = mnist_a1b1$nn, a = 0.5, b = 1.2)
```
