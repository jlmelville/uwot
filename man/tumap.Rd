\arguments{
\item{X}{Input data. Can be a \code{\link{data.frame}}, \code{\link{matrix}},
\code{\link[stats]{dist}} object or \code{\link[Matrix]{sparseMatrix}}.
Matrix and data frames should contain one observation per row. Data frames
will have any non-numeric columns removed, although factor columns will be
used if explicitly included via \code{metric} (see the help for
\code{metric} for details). A sparse matrix is interpreted as a distance
matrix, and is assumed to be symmetric, so you can also pass in an
explicitly upper or lower triangular sparse matrix to save storage. There
must be at least \code{n_neighbors} non-zero distances for each row. Both
implicit and explicit zero entries are ignored. Set zero distances you want
to keep to an arbitrarily small non-zero value (e.g. \code{1e-10}).
\code{X} can also be \code{NULL} if pre-computed nearest neighbor data is
passed to \code{nn_method}, and \code{init} is not \code{"spca"} or
\code{"pca"}.}

\item{n_neighbors}{The size of local neighborhood (in terms of number of
neighboring sample points) used for manifold approximation. Larger values
result in more global views of the manifold, while smaller values result in
more local data being preserved. In general values should be in the range
\code{2} to \code{100}.}

\item{n_components}{The dimension of the space to embed into. This defaults
to \code{2} to provide easy visualization, but can reasonably be set to any
integer value in the range \code{2} to \code{100}.}

\item{metric}{Type of distance metric to use to find nearest neighbors. One
  of:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"euclidean"} (the default)
  \item \code{"cosine"}
  \item \code{"manhattan"}
  \item \code{"hamming"}
  \item \code{"correlation"} (a distance based on the Pearson correlation)
  \item \code{"categorical"} (see below)
}
Only applies if \code{nn_method = "annoy"} (for \code{nn_method = "fnn"}, the
distance metric is always "euclidean").

If \code{X} is a data frame or matrix, then multiple metrics can be
specified, by passing a list to this argument, where the name of each item in
the list is one of the metric names above. The value of each list item should
be a vector giving the names or integer ids of the columns to be included in
a calculation, e.g. \code{metric = list(euclidean = 1:4, manhattan = 5:10)}.

Each metric calculation results in a separate fuzzy simplicial set, which are
intersected together to produce the final set. Metric names can be repeated.
Because non-numeric columns are removed from the data frame, it is safer to
use column names than integer ids.

Factor columns can also be used by specifying the metric name
\code{"categorical"}. Factor columns are treated different from numeric
columns and although multiple factor columns can be specified in a vector,
each factor column specified is processed individually. If you specify
a non-factor column, it will be coerced to a factor.

For a given data block, you may override the \code{pca} and \code{pca_center}
arguments for that block, by providing a list with one unnamed item
containing the column names or ids, and then any of the \code{pca} or
\code{pca_center} overrides as named items, e.g. \code{metric =
list(euclidean = 1:4, manhattan = list(5:10, pca_center = FALSE))}. This
exists to allow mixed binary and real-valued data to be included and to have
PCA applied to both, but with centering applied only to the real-valued data
(it is typical not to apply centering to binary data before PCA is applied).}

\item{n_epochs}{Number of epochs to use during the optimization of the
embedded coordinates. By default, this value is set to \code{500} for
datasets containing 10,000 vertices or less, and \code{200} otherwise.
If \code{n_epochs = 0}, then coordinates determined by \code{"init"} will
be returned.}

\item{learning_rate}{Initial learning rate used in optimization of the
coordinates.}

\item{scale}{Scaling to apply to \code{X} if it is a data frame or matrix:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{"none"} or \code{FALSE} or \code{NULL}} No scaling.
  \item{\code{"Z"} or \code{"scale"} or \code{TRUE}} Scale each column to
  zero mean and variance 1.
  \item{\code{"maxabs"}} Center each column to mean 0, then divide each
  element by the maximum absolute value over the entire matrix.
  \item{\code{"range"}} Range scale the entire matrix, so the smallest
  element is 0 and the largest is 1.
  \item{\code{"colrange"}} Scale each column in the range (0,1).
}
For t-UMAP, the default is \code{"none"}.}

\item{init}{Type of initialization for the coordinates. Options are:
 \itemize{
   \item \code{"spectral"} Spectral embedding using the normalized Laplacian
   of the fuzzy 1-skeleton, with Gaussian noise added.
   \item \code{"normlaplacian"}. Spectral embedding using the normalized
   Laplacian of the fuzzy 1-skeleton, without noise.
   \item \code{"random"}. Coordinates assigned using a uniform random
   distribution between -10 and 10.
   \item \code{"lvrandom"}. Coordinates assigned using a Gaussian
   distribution with standard deviation 1e-4, as used in LargeVis
   (Tang et al., 2016) and t-SNE.
   \item \code{"laplacian"}. Spectral embedding using the Laplacian Eigenmap
   (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002).
   \item \code{"pca"}. The first two principal components from PCA of
   \code{X} if \code{X} is a data frame, and from a 2-dimensional classical
   MDS if \code{X} is of class \code{"dist"}.
   \item \code{"spca"}. Like \code{"pca"}, but each dimension is then scaled
   so the standard deviation is 1e-4, to give a distribution similar to that
   used in t-SNE. This is an alias for \code{init = "pca", init_sdev =
   1e-4}.
   \item \code{"agspectral"} An "approximate global" modification of
   \code{"spectral"} which all edges in the graph to a value of 1, and then
   sets a random number of edges (\code{negative_sample_rate} edges per
   vertex) to 0.1, to approximate the effect of non-local affinities.
   \item A matrix of initial coordinates.
 }
For spectral initializations, (\code{"spectral"}, \code{"normlaplacian"},
\code{"laplacian"}), if more than one connected component is identified,
each connected component is initialized separately and the results are
merged. If \code{verbose = TRUE} the number of connected components are
logged to the console. The existence of multiple connected components
implies that a global view of the data cannot be attained with this
initialization. Either a PCA-based initialization or increasing the value of
\code{n_neighbors} may be more appropriate.}

\item{init_sdev}{If non-\code{NULL}, scales each dimension of the initialized
coordinates (including any user-supplied matrix) to this standard
deviation. By default no scaling is carried out, except when \code{init =
"spca"}, in which case the value is \code{0.0001}. Scaling the input may
help if the unscaled versions result in initial coordinates with large
inter-point distances or outliers. This usually results in small gradients
during optimization and very little progress being made to the layout.
Shrinking the initial embedding by rescaling can help under these
circumstances. Scaling the result of \code{init = "pca"} is usually
recommended and \code{init = "spca"} as an alias for \code{init = "pca",
init_sdev = 1e-4} but for the spectral initializations the scaled versions
usually aren't necessary unless you are using a large value of
\code{n_neighbors} (e.g. \code{n_neighbors = 150} or higher).}

\item{set_op_mix_ratio}{Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as
the set operation used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a
global fuzzy simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product
t-norm. The value of this parameter should be between \code{0.0} and
\code{1.0}; a value of \code{1.0} will use a pure fuzzy union, while
\code{0.0} will use a pure fuzzy intersection.}

\item{local_connectivity}{The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number
of nearest neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local
level. The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
dimension of the manifold.}

\item{bandwidth}{The effective bandwidth of the kernel if we view the
algorithm as similar to Laplacian Eigenmaps. Larger values induce more
connectivity and a more global view of the data, smaller values concentrate
more locally.}

\item{repulsion_strength}{Weighting applied to negative samples in low
dimensional embedding optimization. Values higher than one will result in
greater weight being given to negative samples.}

\item{negative_sample_rate}{The number of negative edge/1-simplex samples to
use per positive edge/1-simplex sample in optimizing the low dimensional
embedding.}

\item{nn_method}{Method for finding nearest neighbors. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"fnn"}. Use exact nearest neighbors via the
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=FNN}{FNN} package.
  \item \code{"annoy"} Use approximate nearest neighbors via the
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy}{RcppAnnoy} package.
 }
By default, if \code{X} has less than 4,096 vertices, the exact nearest
neighbors are found. Otherwise, approximate nearest neighbors are used.
You may also pass pre-calculated nearest neighbor data to this argument. It
must be a list consisting of two elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"idx"}. A \code{n_vertices x n_neighbors} matrix
  containing the integer indexes of the nearest neighbors in \code{X}. Each
  vertex is considered to be its own nearest neighbor, i.e.
  \code{idx[, 1] == 1:n_vertices}.
  \item \code{"dist"}. A \code{n_vertices x n_neighbors} matrix
  containing the distances of the nearest neighbors.
}
Multiple nearest neighbor data (e.g. from two different pre-calculated
metrics) can be passed by passing a list containing the nearest neighbor
data lists as items.
The \code{n_neighbors} parameter is ignored when using pre-calculated
nearest neighbor data.}

\item{n_trees}{Number of trees to build when constructing the nearest
neighbor index. The more trees specified, the larger the index, but the
better the results. With \code{search_k}, determines the accuracy of the
Annoy nearest neighbor search. Only used if the \code{nn_method} is
\code{"annoy"}. Sensible values are between \code{10} to \code{100}.}

\item{search_k}{Number of nodes to search during the neighbor retrieval. The
larger k, the more the accurate results, but the longer the search takes.
With \code{n_trees}, determines the accuracy of the Annoy nearest neighbor
search. Only used if the \code{nn_method} is \code{"annoy"}.}

\item{n_threads}{Number of threads to use (except during stochastic gradient
descent). Default is half the number of concurrent threads supported by the
system. For nearest neighbor search, only applies if 
\code{nn_method = "annoy"}. If \code{n_threads > 1}, then the Annoy index 
will be temporarily written to disk in the location determined by
\code{\link[base]{tempfile}}.}

\item{n_sgd_threads}{Number of threads to use during stochastic gradient
descent. If set to > 1, then be aware that if \code{batch = FALSE}, results
will \emph{not} be reproducible, even if \code{set.seed} is called with a
fixed seed before running. Set to \code{"auto"} to use the same value as
\code{n_threads}.}

\item{grain_size}{The minimum amount of work to do on each thread. If this
value is set high enough, then less than \code{n_threads} or
\code{n_sgd_threads} will be used for processing, which might give a
performance improvement if the overhead of thread management and context
switching was outweighing the improvement due to concurrent processing.
This should be left at default (\code{1}) and work will be spread evenly
over all the threads specified.}

\item{y}{Optional target data for supervised dimension reduction. Can be a
vector, matrix or data frame. Use the \code{target_metric} parameter to
specify the metrics to use, using the same syntax as \code{metric}. Usually
either a single numeric or factor column is used, but more complex formats
are possible. The following types are allowed:
  \itemize{
    \item Factor columns with the same length as \code{X}. \code{NA} is
    allowed for any observation with an unknown level, in which case
    UMAP operates as a form of semi-supervised learning. Each column is
    treated separately.
    \item Numeric data. \code{NA} is \emph{not} allowed in this case. Use the
    parameter \code{target_n_neighbors} to set the number of neighbors used
    with \code{y}. If unset, \code{n_neighbors} is used. Unlike factors,
    numeric columns are grouped into one block unless \code{target_metric}
    specifies otherwise. For example, if you wish columns \code{a} and
    \code{b} to be treated separately, specify
    \code{target_metric = list(euclidean = "a", euclidean = "b")}. Otherwise,
    the data will be effectively treated as a matrix with two columns.
    \item Nearest neighbor data, consisting of a list of two matrices,
    \code{idx} and \code{dist}. These represent the precalculated nearest
    neighbor indices and distances, respectively. This
    is the same format as that expected for precalculated data in
    \code{nn_method}. This format assumes that the underlying data was a
    numeric vector. Any user-supplied value of the \code{target_n_neighbors}
    parameter is ignored in this case, because the the number of columns in
    the matrices is used for the value. Multiple nearest neighbor data using
    different metrics can be supplied by passing a list of these lists.
  }
Unlike \code{X}, all factor columns included in \code{y} are automatically
used.}

\item{target_n_neighbors}{Number of nearest neighbors to use to construct the
target simplicial set. Default value is \code{n_neighbors}. Applies only if
\code{y} is non-\code{NULL} and \code{numeric}.}

\item{target_metric}{The metric used to measure distance for \code{y} if
using supervised dimension reduction. Used only if \code{y} is numeric.}

\item{target_weight}{Weighting factor between data topology and target
topology. A value of 0.0 weights entirely on data, a value of 1.0 weights
entirely on target. The default of 0.5 balances the weighting equally
between data and target. Only applies if \code{y} is non-\code{NULL}.}

\item{pca}{If set to a positive integer value, reduce data to this number of
columns using PCA. Doesn't applied if the distance \code{metric} is
\code{"hamming"}, or the dimensions of the data is larger than the
number specified (i.e. number of rows and columns must be larger than the
value of this parameter). If you have > 100 columns in a data frame or
matrix, reducing the number of columns in this way may substantially
increase the performance of the nearest neighbor search at the cost of a
potential decrease in accuracy. In many t-SNE applications, a value of 50
is recommended, although there's no guarantee that this is appropriate for
all settings.}

\item{pca_center}{If \code{TRUE}, center the columns of \code{X} before
carrying out PCA. For binary data, it's recommended to set this to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{pcg_rand}{If \code{TRUE}, use the PCG random number generator (O'Neill,
2014) during optimization. Otherwise, use the faster (but probably less
statistically good) Tausworthe "taus88" generator. The default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{fast_sgd}{If \code{TRUE}, then the following combination of parameters
is set: \code{pcg_rand = TRUE} and \code{n_sgd_threads = "auto"}. The
default is \code{FALSE}. Setting this to \code{TRUE} will speed up the
stochastic optimization phase, but give a potentially less accurate
embedding, and which will not be exactly reproducible even with a fixed
seed. For visualization, \code{fast_sgd = TRUE} will give perfectly good
results. For more generic dimensionality reduction, it's safer to leave
\code{fast_sgd = FALSE}. If \code{fast_sgd = TRUE}, then user-supplied
values of \code{pcg_rand} and \code{n_sgd_threads}, are ignored.}

\item{ret_model}{If \code{TRUE}, then return extra data that can be used to
add new data to an existing embedding via \code{\link{umap_transform}}. The
embedded coordinates are returned as the list item \code{embedding}. If
\code{FALSE}, just return the coordinates. This parameter can be used in
conjunction with \code{ret_nn} and \code{ret_extra}. Note that some
settings are incompatible with the production of a UMAP model: external
neighbor data (passed via a list to \code{nn_method}), and factor columns
that were included via the \code{metric} parameter. In the latter case, the
model produced is based only on the numeric data. A transformation using
new data is possible, but the factor columns in the new data are ignored.}

\item{ret_nn}{If \code{TRUE}, then in addition to the embedding, also return
nearest neighbor data that can be used as input to \code{nn_method} to
avoid the overhead of repeatedly calculating the nearest neighbors when
manipulating unrelated parameters (e.g. \code{min_dist}, \code{n_epochs},
\code{init}). See the "Value" section for the names of the list items. If
\code{FALSE}, just return the coordinates. Note that the nearest neighbors
could be sensitive to data scaling, so be wary of reusing nearest neighbor
data if modifying the \code{scale} parameter. This parameter can be used in
conjunction with \code{ret_model} and \code{ret_extra}.}

\item{ret_extra}{A vector indicating what extra data to return. May contain
any combination of the following strings:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"model"} Same as setting \code{ret_model = TRUE}.
  \item \code{"nn"} Same as setting \code{ret_nn = TRUE}.
  \item \code{"fgraph"} the high dimensional fuzzy graph (i.e. the fuzzy
    simplicial set of the merged local views of the input data). The graph
    is returned as a sparse symmetric N x N matrix of class
    \link[Matrix]{dgCMatrix-class}, where a non-zero entry (i, j) gives the
    membership strength of the edge connecting vertex i and vertex j. This
    can be considered analogous to the input probability (or similarity or
    affinity) used in t-SNE and LargeVis. Note that the graph is further
    sparsified by removing edges with sufficiently low membership strength
    that they would not be sampled by the probabilistic edge sampling
    employed for optimization and therefore the number of non-zero elements
    in the matrix is dependent on \code{n_epochs}. If you are only
    interested in the fuzzy input graph (e.g. for clustering), setting
    \code{n_epochs = 0} will avoid any further sparsifying.
}}

\item{tmpdir}{Temporary directory to store nearest neighbor indexes during
nearest neighbor search. Default is \code{\link{tempdir}}. The index is
only written to disk if \code{n_threads > 1} and
\code{nn_method = "annoy"}; otherwise, this parameter is ignored.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, log details to the console.}

\item{batch}{If \code{TRUE}, then embedding coordinates are updated at the
end of each epoch rather than during the epoch. In batch mode, results are
reproducible with a fixed random seed even with \code{n_sgd_threads > 1},
at the cost of a slightly higher memory use. You may also have to modify
\code{learning_rate} and increase \code{n_epochs}, so whether this provides
a speed increase over the single-threaded optimization is likely to be
dataset and hardware-dependent.}

\item{opt_args}{A list of optimizer parameters, used when 
\code{batch = TRUE}. The default optimization method used is Adam (Kingma
and Ba, 2014).
\itemize{
  \item \code{method} The optimization method to use. Either \code{"adam"} 
  or \code{"sgd"} (stochastic gradient descent). Default: \code{"adam"}.
  \item \code{beta1} (Adam only). The weighting parameter for the
  exponential moving average of the first moment estimator. Effectively the
  momentum parameter. Should be a floating point value between 0 and 1.
  Higher values can smooth oscillatory updates in poorly-conditioned
  situations and may allow for a larger \code{learning_rate} to be
  specified, but too high can cause divergence. Default: \code{0.5}.
  \item \code{beta2} (Adam only). The weighting parameter for the
  exponential moving average of the uncentered second moment estimator.
  Should be a floating point value between 0 and 1. Controls the degree of
  adaptivity in the step-size. Higher values put more weight on previous
  time steps. Default: \code{0.9}.
  \item \code{eps} (Adam only). Intended to be a small value to prevent
  division by zero, but in practice can also affect convergence due to its
  interaction with \code{beta2}. Higher values reduce the effect of the
  step-size adaptivity and bring the behavior closer to stochastic gradient
  descent with momentum. Typical values are between 1e-8 and 1e-3. Default:
  \code{1e-7}.
  \item \code{alpha} The initial learning rate. Default: the value of the 
  \code{learning_rate} parameter.
}}

\item{epoch_callback}{A function which will be invoked at the end of every
epoch. Its signature should be: \code{(epoch, n_epochs, coords)}, where:
\itemize{
  \item \code{epoch} The current epoch number (between \code{1} and 
  \code{n_epochs}).
  \item \code{n_epochs} Number of epochs to use during the optimization of
  the embedded coordinates.
  \item \code{coords} The embedded coordinates as of the end of the current
  epoch, as a matrix with dimensions (N, \code{n_components}).
}}

\item{pca_method}{Method to carry out any PCA dimensionality reduction when
the \code{pca} parameter is specified. Allowed values are: 
\itemize{
  \item{\code{"irlba"}}. Uses \code{\link[irlba]{prcomp_irlba}} from the
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=irlba}{irlba} package.
  \item{\code{"rsvd"}}. Uses 5 iterations of \code{\link[irlba]{svdr}} from
  the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=irlba}{irlba} package.
  This is likely to give much faster but potentially less accurate results
  than using \code{"irlba"}. For the purposes of nearest neighbor 
  calculation and coordinates initialization, any loss of accuracy doesn't
  seem to matter much.
  \item{\code{"bigstatsr"}}. Uses \code{\link[bigstatsr]{big_randomSVD}}
  from the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=bigstatsr}{bigstatsr}
  package. The SVD methods used in \code{bigstatsr} may be faster on 
  systems without access to efficient linear algebra libraries (e.g. 
  Windows). \strong{Note}: \code{bigstatsr} is \emph{not} a dependency of
  uwot: if you choose to use this package for PCA, you \emph{must} install
  it yourself.
  \item{\code{"svd"}}. Uses \code{\link[base]{svd}} for the SVD. This is
  likely to be slow for all but the smallest datasets.
  \item{\code{"auto"}} (the default). Uses \code{"irlba"}, unless more than
  50% of the full set of singular vectors would be calculated, in which
  case \code{"svd"} is used.
}}

\item{binary_edge_weights}{If \code{TRUE} then edge weights in the input
graph are treated as binary (0/1) rather than real valued. This affects the
sampling frequency of neighbors and is the strategy used by the PaCMAP
method (Wang and co-workers, 2020). Practical (Böhm and co-workers, 2020)
and theoretical (Damrich and Hamprecht, 2021) work suggests this has little
effect on UMAP's performance.}
}
\value{
A matrix of optimized coordinates, or:
  \itemize{
    \item if \code{ret_model = TRUE} (or \code{ret_extra} contains
    \code{"model"}), returns a list containing extra information that can be
    used to add new data to an existing embedding via
    \code{\link{umap_transform}}. In this case, the coordinates are available
    in the list item \code{embedding}. \bold{NOTE}: The contents of 
    the \code{model} list should \emph{not} be considered stable or part of
    the public API, and are purposely left undocumented.
    \item if \code{ret_nn = TRUE} (or \code{ret_extra} contains \code{"nn"}),
    returns the nearest neighbor data as a list called \code{nn}. This
    contains one list for each \code{metric} calculated, itself containing a
    matrix \code{idx} with the integer ids of the neighbors; and a matrix
    \code{dist} with the distances. The \code{nn} list (or a sub-list) can be
    used as input to the \code{nn_method} parameter.
    \item if \code{ret_extra} contains \code{"fgraph"} returns the high
    dimensional fuzzy graph as a sparse matrix called \code{fgraph}, of type
    \link[Matrix]{dgCMatrix-class}.
  }
  The returned list contains the combined data from any combination of
  specifying \code{ret_model}, \code{ret_nn} and \code{ret_extra}.

\description{
A faster (but less flexible) version of the UMAP gradient. For more detail on
UMAP, see the  \code{\link{umap}} function.
}
\details{
By setting the UMAP curve parameters \code{a} and \code{b} to \code{1}, you
get back the Cauchy distribution as used in t-SNE and LargeVis. It also
results in a substantially simplified gradient expression. This can give
a speed improvement of around 50\%.
