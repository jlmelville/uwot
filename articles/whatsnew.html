<p>A place for me to put the old less-structured updates that I post at
the top of the <code>README.md</code> file for the package. When they
aren’t new any more, they will get moved here. You should look at the <a href="https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/news/index.html">Changelog</a>
for fuller details.</p>
<p><em>April 21 2024</em> As ordained by prophecy, version 0.2.2 of
<code>uwot</code> has been released to CRAN. <code>RSpectra</code> is
back as a main dependency and I <em>thought</em> I had worked out a
clever scheme to avoid the failures seen in some installations with the
<code>irlba</code>/<code>Matrix</code> interactions. This releases fixes
the problem on all the systems I have access to (including GitHub
Actions CI) but some CRAN checks remain failing. How embarrassing. That
said, if you have had issues, it’s possible this new release will help
you too.</p>
<p><em>April 18 2024</em> Version 0.2.1 of <code>uwot</code> has been
released to CRAN. Some features to be aware of: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnndescent" class="external-link">RcppHNSW</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnndescent" class="external-link">rnndescent</a> are
now supported as optional dependencies. If you install and load them,
you can use them as an alternative to RcppAnnoy in the nearest neighbor
search and should be faster. Also, a new <code>umap2</code> function has
been added, with updated defaults compared to <code>umap</code>. Please
see the updated and new articles on <a href="https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/hnsw-umap.html">HNSW</a>,
<a href="https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/rnndescent-umap.html">rnndescent</a>,
<a href="https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/sparse-data-example.html">working
with sparse data</a> and <a href="https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/umap2.html">umap2</a>.
I consider this worthy of moving from <code>0.1.x</code> to
<code>0.2.x</code>, but in the interests of full disclosure, on-going <a href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/115" class="external-link">irlba problems</a>
has caused a CRAN check failure, so we might be onto 0.2.2 sooner than
I’d like.</p>
<p><em>November 26 2023</em> Happy 1 million CRAN downloads to
<code>uwot</code>. To celebrate (actually it’s just a coincidence) I
have reorganized the horror-show that was the sprawling README into
actual articles, via the fantastic <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">pkgdown</a> package. Find it at <a href="https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/" class="uri">https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/</a>.</p>
<p><em>June 28 2023</em> Version 0.1.16 has been released to CRAN. This
is a very minor tweak to 0.1.15 to further support the new release of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy" class="external-link">RcppAnnoy</a>.</p>
<p><em>June 28 2023</em> Version 0.1.16 has been released to CRAN. This
is a very minor tweak to 0.1.15 to further support the new release of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy" class="external-link">RcppAnnoy</a>.</p>
<p><em>June 26 2023</em> Version 0.1.15 has been released to CRAN. This
is to support a new release of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy" class="external-link">RcppAnnoy</a>, but
there are also some bug fixes and other minor improvements. There are
some new functions: <code>optimize_graph_layout</code> will carry out
the UMAP optimization step on a sparse similiarity matrix, e.g. the
output of <code>similarity_graph</code>.
<code>simplicial_set_union</code> and
<code>simplicial_set_intersect</code> provide ways to merge different
views of the same data into one sparse similiarity matrix. As usual,
<code>NEWS.md</code> has all the details.</p>
<p><em>August 22 2022</em> Just when you least expected it, version
0.1.14 has been released to CRAN (the <code>NEWS</code> file on CRAN
calls it <code>0.1.13.9000</code> because I forgot to update that file,
but let’s keep that amongst ourselves). This release includes a bug fix
for <code>umap_transform</code> when you use external nearest neighbors
and new function <code>similarity_graph</code>, to support extracting
just the high dimensional fuzzy simplicial set.</p>
<p><em>August 16 2022</em> Version 0.1.13 has been released to CRAN
(0.1.12 was a failed submission). Among other things you can now pass
your own nearest neighbors data in sparse matrix form. Also there is an
option to reproduce relative cluster density by <a href="https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/leopold.html">approximating
the densMAP method</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/blob/master/NEWS.md#uwot-0113" class="external-link">NEWS</a>
page for more.</p>
<p><em>December 12 2021</em> Version 0.1.11 has been released to CRAN.
It is now possible to get reproducible results (for a given value of
<code>set.seed</code>) when running the optimization step with multiple
threads (<code>n_sgd_threads</code> greater than 1). You may need to
increase <code>n_epochs</code> to get similar levels of convergence. To
run in this mode, set <code>batch = TRUE</code>. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/LTLA" class="external-link">Aaron Lun</a> who came up with the design
for this and also implemented it in his <a href="https://github.com/libscran/umappp" class="external-link">umappp C++ library</a>. See
<code>NEWS.md</code> for other changes.</p>
<p><em>December 15 2020</em> Version 0.1.10 has been released to CRAN.
This is mainly to maintain compatibility with RcppAnnoy, but also a
small change was made to avoid it grinding away pointlessly in the
presence of <code>NA</code> values, based on an observation by David
McGaughey on Twitter (which I can no longer link to).</p>
<p><em>November 15 2020</em> Version 0.1.9 has been released to CRAN.
The main addition is support for the Pearson correlation. Also, a slight
license change from GPL-3 to GPL-3 or later.</p>
<p><em>August 1 2020</em> New metric supported: Pearson correlation
(with <code>metric = "correlation"</code>). This should give similar
results to the Python UMAP (and sklearn) implementation of the
<code>correlation</code> metric.</p>
<p><em>March 16 2020</em> A new version (0.1.8) is on CRAN. This is a
minor release in terms of features, but you can now export the UMAP
graph (<a href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/47" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/47</a>), and there
are some bug fixes for: loading Annoy indexes (<a href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/31" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/31</a>),
reproducibility across platforms (<a href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/46" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot/issues/46</a>) and we no
longer use RcppParallel for the multi-threading support, which should
lead to fewer installation problems.</p>
<p><em>March 4 2020</em> I had to cancel my submission of version 0.1.7
to CRAN because of a broken example in a library using uwot. In the mean
time I have switched to using <code>std::thread</code> rather than
tinythread++.</p>
<p><em>March 1 2020</em> Version 0.1.6 was rejected from CRAN due to
undefined behavior issues that originate from RcppAnnoy and
RcppParallel. I am hopeful that the Annoy behavior is fixed and a
suitable version of RcppAnnoy will be released onto CRAN eventually. The
RcppParallel issues originate with the use of <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB" class="external-link">tbb</a> and seems much
harder to deal with. As there is no way to use RcppParallel without tbb
yet, I am temporarily replacing the use of RcppParallel with just a
subset of the code needed to run parallel for loops with the <a href="https://tinythreadpp.bitsnbites.eu/" class="external-link">tinythread++</a> library.</p>
<p><em>December 4 2019</em> Version 0.1.5 released on CRAN. This fixes a
couple of crash bugs, including one where the R API was being called
from inside a thread. This may have been causing the issues seen by
users of <a href="https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3/issues/186" class="external-link">monocle</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/2256" class="external-link">seurat</a>.</p>
<p><em>September 23 2019</em> Version 0.1.4 released on CRAN. This
ensures compatibility with RcppAnnoy 0.0.13 when using
<code>load_uwot</code>.</p>
<p><em>April 6 2019</em>. uwot is now on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=uwot" class="external-link">CRAN</a>. Also, some
minor-to-horrible bugs in the <code>lvish</code> perplexity routine have
been fixed.</p>
<p>For visualization purposes, it seems reasonable to use the old PRNG
(<code>pcg_rand = FALSE</code>), along with multiple threads during SGD
(<code>n_sgd_threads = "auto"</code>), and the UMAP gradient
approximation (<code>approx_pow = TRUE</code>), which combined will show
a very noticeable speed up during optimization. I have added a new
parameter, <code>fast_sgd</code>, which if set to <code>TRUE</code>,
sets these options for you.</p>
