# Nearest Neighbor Format

The Python implementation of UMAP supports lots of distance metrics;
`uwot` does not, because it depends on the distance metrics supported by
`RcppAnnoy`, which in turn depends on those supported by `Annoy`. For
more flexibility, at the cost of convenience, you can generate nearest
neighbor data for `X` by some other means and pass that to `umap` (or
`tumap` or `lvish`) directly via the `nn_method` parameter.

## Nearest Neighbor Graph Format

The format expected by `nn_method` is a `list` containing the following
two entries:

- `idx`: a matrix of dimension `n_vertices x n_neighbors`, where each
  row contains the indexes (starting at `1`) of the nearest neighbors of
  each item (vertex) in the dataset. Each item is always the nearest
  neighbor of itself, so the first element in row `i` should always be
  `i`. If it isn’t then either you are using a really weird non-metric
  distance or your approximate nearest neighbor method is returning way
  too approximate results. In either case, you should expect bad
  results.
- `dist`: a matrix of dimension `n_vertices x n_neighbors`, where each
  row contains the distances of the nearest neighbors of each item
  (vertex) in the dataset, in Each item is always the nearest neighbor
  of itself, so the first element in row `i` should always be `0.0`.

## Sparse Distance Matrix Format

Alternatively, you can pass a sparse distance matrix where:

- the format should be `dgCMatrix` (the typical sparse matrix format).
- non-zero entries are the distances.
- dimensions are of `n_vertices x n_vertices` for `umap` and
  `n_model_vertices x n_vertices` for `umap_transform`
  - to put it another way: the neighbor distances should be arranged so
    that the non-zero entries in the `i`th column of the matrix contains
    the distances between observation `i` and its nearest neighbors.
- An advantage of using a sparse distance matrix: you are not restricted
  to a fixed value of `n_neighbors` for each observation. Each column
  can contain a different number of non-zero distances. See the paper by
  [Dalmia and Sia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05525) for why you might
  want to do this. The graph edge weight calculation will be adjusted to
  account for the different number of neighbors of each observation.
  There must be at least one neighbor for each observation.
- Explicit zero distances will be removed from the matrix. This is in
  contrast to the use of the nearest neighbor list matrix format where
  typically the zero distance between an observation and itself is found
  as part of the nearest neighbor search routine. The sparse distance
  matrix approach will account for the zero self-distance being
  implicit. To keep explicit zero distances between other observations
  set them to a small but non-zero value, e.g. `1e-10`.
- A slight disadvantage with using a distance matrix is that the
  distances need to be sorted.
- Sparse distance matrix input is not currently supported for the
  `lvish` method.

If you use pre-computed nearest neighbor data, be aware that:

- You can’t use pre-computed nearest neighbor data and also use
  `metric`.
- You can explicitly set `X` to NULL, as long as you don’t try and use
  an initialization method that makes use of `X` (`init = "pca"` or
  `init = "spca"`).
- You *can* transform new data by setting `ret_model = TRUE`. You must
  provide `umap_transform` with the distances between new data and the
  original data via its `nn_method` parameter.

Here’s an example of using pre-computed nearest neighbor data using the
even-numbered observations in `iris` to build an initial model and then
transforming the odd-numbered observations. This relies on some internal
`uwot` functions which I do not promise have a stable API (i.e. this may
example may be broken when you read this), but it gives you the general
idea:

``` r
iris_even <- iris[seq(2, nrow(iris), 2), ]
iris_odd <- iris[seq(1, nrow(iris), 2), ]

iris_even_nn <- uwot:::annoy_nn(
  X = uwot:::x2m(iris_even),
  k = 15,
  metric = "euclidean",
  ret_index = TRUE
)

iris_odd_nn <- annoy_search(
  X = uwot:::x2m(iris_odd),
  k = 15,
  ann = iris_even_nn$index
)

# Delete the Annoy index, force the transform method to use the nn distances 
# directly
iris_even_nn$index <- NULL

iris_even_umap <-
  umap(
    X = NULL,
    nn_method = iris_even_nn,
    ret_model = TRUE
  )

iris_odd_transform <-
  umap_transform(X = NULL, iris_even_umap, nn_method = iris_odd_nn)
```

## Exporting nearest neighbor data from `uwot`

If you set `ret_nn = TRUE`, the return value of `umap` will be a list,
and the `nn` item contains the nearest neighbor data in a format that
can be used with `nn_method`. This is handy if you are going to be
running UMAP multiple times with the same data and `n_neighbors` and
`scale` settings, because the nearest neighbor calculation can be the
most time-consuming part of the calculation.

Normally the contents of `nn` is itself a list, the value of which is
the nearest neighbor data. The name is the type of metric that generated
the data. As an example, here’s what the first few items of the `iris`
5-NN data should look like:

``` r
lapply(umap(iris, ret_nn = TRUE, n_neighbors = 5)$nn$euclidean, head)

$`idx`
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1   18    5   40   29
[2,]    2   35   46   13   10
[3,]    3   48    4    7   13
[4,]    4   48   30   31    3
[5,]    5   38    1   18   41
[6,]    6   19   11   49   45

$dist
     [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]      [,5]
[1,]    0 0.1000000 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1414214
[2,]    0 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1732051
[3,]    0 0.1414214 0.2449490 0.2645751 0.2645751
[4,]    0 0.1414214 0.1732051 0.2236068 0.2449490
[5,]    0 0.1414214 0.1414214 0.1732051 0.1732051
[6,]    0 0.3316625 0.3464102 0.3605551 0.3741657
```

If for some reason you specify `ret_nn` while supplying precomputed
nearest neighbor data to `nn_method`, the returned data should be
identical to what you passed in, and the list item names will be
`precomputed`.

## Multiple neighbor data

As discussed under the [Mixed Data
Types](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/articles/mixed-data-types.html)
article, you can apply multiple distance metrics to different parts of
matrix or data frame input data. if you do this, then `ret_nn` will
return all the neighbor data. The list under `nn` will now contain as
many items as metrics, in the order they were specified. For instance,
if the `metric` argument is:

``` r
metric = list("euclidean" = c("Petal.Width", "Petal.Length"),
              "cosine" = c("Sepal.Width", "Sepal.Length"))
```

The `nn` list will contain two list entries. The first will be called
`euclidean` and the second `cosine`.

If you have access to multiple distance metrics, you may also provide
multiple precomputed neighbor data to `nn_method` in the same format: a
list of lists, where each sublist has the same format as described above
(i.e. the two matrices, `idx` and `dist`). The names of the list items
are ignored, so you don’t need to set them. Roughly, do something like
this:

``` r
nn_metric1 <- list(idx = matrix(...), dist = matrix(...))
nn_metric2 <- list(idx = matrix(...), dist = matrix(...))
umap_res <- umap(nn_method = list(nn_metric1, nn_metric2), ...)
```

The different neighbor data must all have the same number of neighbors,
i.e. the number of columns in all the matrices must be the same.

## Numeric `y`

If you are using supervised UMAP with a numeric `y`, then you can also
pass nearest neighbor data to `y`, using the same format as above. In
this case the nearest neighbors should be with respect to the data in
`y`.

Note that you *cannot* pass categorical `y` as nearest neighbor data.
This is because the processing of the data goes through a different code
path that doesn’t directly calculate nearest neighbors: if `y` is a
factor, when there are only a small number of levels, the number of
neighbors of an item can be vastly larger than `n_neighbors`.

Nearest neighbor data for `y` is not returned from `umap` for re-use.
