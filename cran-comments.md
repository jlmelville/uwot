## R CMD check results

There are no WARNINGs or ERRORs.

There was one NOTE each for these environments:

> On ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release)
  checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is 20.5Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      libs  20.1Mb

> On fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)
  checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is 14.4Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      libs  14.0Mb

> On debian-gcc-release (r-release)
  checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is 14.8Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      libs  14.3Mb

In all cases, this is due to the underlying C++ implementation using templates.

* There was a message about possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  
  McInnes (7:42)
  Rcpp (11:73)
  UMAP (2:59)
  al (7:53, 10:38)
  et (7:50, 10:35)
  uwot (12:57)
     
These are spelled correctly.

## Downstream dependencies

There are 42 reverse dependencies (19 CRAN and 23 BioConductor):

* There is no change to the number of, or type of ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs
generated by these packages with the current version of uwot, compared to the
new submission.
* None of the existing ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs generated by the downstream
dependencies are related to uwot.
